# SW Cantina - Search characters

This is a minimal Vite project setup for React.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js and an NPM compatible package manager.

- Node.js: You need to install Node.js. See the [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install.

## Installation

First, you will need to clone the repo on your local machine. Open your terminal and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliocro/cantina.git
```

After cloning the repo, you have to install the dependencies. You can do this by moving into the project folder and running `npm install`:

cd cantina
npm install
```

## Running the application
